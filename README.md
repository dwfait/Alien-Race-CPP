# Alien Race (C++ Version)

This is a game I wrote in my second year of University in my spare time to gain some more experience in C++.

I later ported the code to Java to be able to embed it on a webpage, which can also be found on my github account.

The code isn't perfect, and there are a few things that stand out - like creating my own Exception class to take a string in the constructor rather than simply inheriting from std::runtime_exception. To see a more thought out C++ program using the cool new C++11 features, take a look at the zombie_game repository I'm currently developing using experience from my use of C++ in industry and personal experience since then.
